						<li>Telemarketing is a very common form of marketing companies use to connect with potential customers of their products or services.</li>
						<li>Historically, telemarketing consisted of companies making telephone calls to existing or potential customers.</li>
						<li>With new technology, telemarketing has expanded to include video conferencing calls as well, although those are typically conducted with existing customers.</li>
						<li>Telemarketing is often used to try to sell a product or service, but it can also take the form of surveys or information gathering.</li>
						<li>For instance, political campaigns use telemarketing heavily prior to elections to inquire about voting preferences.</li>
						<li>When companies call new customers, the activity is referred to as cold calling.</li>

						<li>This means the consumer has not purchased from the company before nor have they requested a call from the company.</li>
						<li>Companies can buy a list of potential customers to call from a list service, which will provide a list of consumers who have similar interests or purchasing histories who fit the company's target market.</li>
